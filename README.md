JavaFx Pirate Battle Ship Game

In the game, players take control of a pirate ship with the goal of eliminating moving dragons using projectiles. The game dynamically tracks the player's score, providing real-time feedback on their progress. The challenge intensifies as players must avoid colliding with dragonsâ€”three collisions result in a game over. However, successfully eliminating all dragons rewards players with a congratulatory message, adding an exciting layer of accomplishment to the experience.
